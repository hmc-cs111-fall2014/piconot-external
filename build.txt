Our version of piconot-external will not have a GUI and only uses the command line output 
maps. To run a piconot file:

1.) Compile the program using SBT
2.) run the program. A fishy promt ><//> should appear waiting for user input 
3.) Input the name of the txt file containing the set of piconot rules 
    followed by the name of txt file containing the maze.
4.) That's all!
