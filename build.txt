To run our Piconot, create a file in our new syntax and place it in the
resources directory of the project. Then, from the command line, cd into
the root of the project. From there, run the following command:
	sbt "run FILE_NAME"

So, for example, if you have placed an "Empty.bot" file in the resources
directory, the command to run that program would be the following:
	sbt "run Empty.bot"

Once you run this command, a new window should pop up with the maze. Just
click "Start" at the top to watch Piconot in action!
