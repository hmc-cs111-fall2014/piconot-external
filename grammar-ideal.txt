    // states can be any number of digits
 	digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
 	state = { digit } ;
 
 	// a surrounding is given by the direction or a restriction or a wildcard
	direction = "N" | "E" | "W" | "S" ;
 	surrounding component = direction | "x" | "*" ;
 	surrounding = surrounding component,  component, surrounding component, surrounding component ;
 
 	// left hand side of arrow has state and surrounding 
 	lhs = state, surrounding ;
 
 	// right hand side specifies movement and next state to go to  
 	movement = direction | "X" ;
 	rhs = movement, state ;
 
 	// a rule is a complete statement, the grammar is any number of rules 
 	rule = lhs , "->", rhs ; 
 	grammar = { rule } ;
