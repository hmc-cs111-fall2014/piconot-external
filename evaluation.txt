We started off using the same syntax as our internal piconot DSL, which had
parentheses and curly braces to make it easier to implement.  We quickly
realized that with an external DSL, these things actually made it harder, so we
got rid of them.

By the same logic, we got rid of semicolons and quotation marks (since
everything is being parsed as a string anyways).

After having implemented everything, we realized that there wasn't any reason to
limit the number of keywords, so we split previously camelCased compound
keywords into multiple words.
