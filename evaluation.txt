Piconot-External Work Diary

--------------------------------------------

Our original syntax idea was:

# This state represents Picobot in situation A.
STATE 0:
	FREE DIRECTIONS: N, S
	BLOCKED DIRECTIONS: E, W
	MOVE DIRECTION: N
	NEW STATE: 0

	FREE DIRECTIONS: E
	BLOCKED DIRECTIONS: W, N
	MOVE DIRECTION: X
	NEW STATE: 1

This is our ideal syntax from the Piconot assignment.

--------------------------------------------

From our experience with the Piconot assignment, we realized that the user
needs some way to specify which maze they would like to run their program on.
To account for this, we decided to add a "RUN MAZE:" construct to a Piconot
program. We also decided (in the interest of not muddying up the parsing) to
forego comments in our syntax. This produces the following syntax:

STATE 0:
	FREE DIRECTIONS: N, S
	BLOCKED DIRECTIONS: E, W
	MOVE DIRECTION: N
	NEW STATE: 0

	FREE DIRECTIONS: E
	BLOCKED DIRECTIONS: W, N
	MOVE DIRECTION: X
	NEW STATE: 1

RUN MAZE: maze.txt
